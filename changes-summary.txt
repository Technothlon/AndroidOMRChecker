UI changes -
    // No need of dragging of points
    // Preview shall not pause and show enhanced crop.
    // cropLayout be visible for 2 seconds : if X is clicked, image is not saved.
    // Implement and Display timer
    change to showing circles instead of page outline / do both
    Name of saving Folder be shown above preview screen
    cancel button should show right when "hold still" is displayed. Picture be saved via a thread to save time (overwrite if ctr not incremented).

Code-only changes -
    Debug findLargestContour dont work on light backgrounds
        //-> Less Preprocessing - only gray-n-threshold! No canny, They not morphing the image beforehand!
        // **** -> (XRAY Button) Make a debug view to see intermediate bitmaps!
                Nope, it only overlays! -  onPictureClicked is the place
                    -> everything is drawn over scanCanvasView _//
    // Debug when adjust angle is shown: its based on maxCosine - seems good when tuned.
    // change onPictureClicked
    add matchTemplate


**** : You can have the app show all these effects to get more "familiar" with them.
//--> canny output
//--> morph output
//--> thresh output
--> template matching output

just4fun :
-> morph close on raw input
-> histogram on raw input

9 Apr:
**Current code works on emulator; but fails on device! Gave a lot of time to debug Xray, it is not primarily required on phone anyway. Now giving a last try before moving on.
Bitmap is too costly! Need to change it.
// Bitmap bitmap = ScanUtils.decodeBitmapFromByteArray(data..
We convert anyway into Mat later. lets have a mat first then.
